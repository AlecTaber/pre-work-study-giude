# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I built this project to help me keep some notes on my prework before the bootcamp starts. I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to be better prepared for this upcoming course. It will help me remember a few key concepts and terms for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I learned some of the basics of coding and web devolpment and I am excited to further my skills in the coming months!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
